enex-dump
=========

PHP script that accepts an Evernote export (ENEX) file and produces a folder of plain text documents.

Please see comment at top of script for configuration and usage instructions.

Note about non-breaking spaces
------------------------------

I've found out the hard way that ENEX exports often contain non-breaking space characters (0xA0) that you may not notice right away because they look like regular spaces.  This script does not remove them, so be aware that they might exist.

Now this script supports processing of file passed via command line arg.
